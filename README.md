# StitchPro
Python app for reconstruction of tissue quadrants into a complete pseudo-whole-mount histopathology prostate section.

This repository includes the Python algorithm developed for stitching of prostate quadrants into an entire prostate section and a folder with four test histopathology prostate quadrants digitized at the Champalimaud Clinical Center. Our algorithm is based in three main steps - boundary detection, histogram matching, and differential evolution optimization - and is intuitive to run as a Streamlit application, keeping the user input to a minimum who only needs to provide as arguments the tissue fragments to be reconstructed.
 
### Repository Structure
- StitchPro.py: Python algorithm for stitching.
- test-data: Folder containing the required image quadrants labeled as ur (upper-right), br (bottom-right), bl (bottom-left), ul (upper-left).
- requirements.txt: Text file with the necessary Python packages for this algorithm.

### Compatibility
The four quadrants need to be image files provided in TIFF (.tif) format.

### Usage
This algorithm was created to be run as a streamlit application.

1) Clone this repository to your local folder;

2) Install the necessary Python packages under requirements.txt;

3) Go to your local folder and run the app using the command line:
`$ streamlit run StitchPro.py`

4) On the app upload the four quadrant images to be reconstructed and, for each quadrant, modify the angle to rotate the fragments, the median filter size and the binary closing footprint parameters (if necessary), and press "Start stitching!".
